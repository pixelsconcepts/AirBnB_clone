AirBnB_clone is a full stack web application

This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

The Command Interpreter accepts and executes some specifi command like shell, but in this case it will do the following:

Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
Update attributes of an object
Destroy an object

To start the interpreter: (type: ./console.py )

Usage: (hbnb) <command>

examples:
Ex: (hbnb) create BaseModel
Ex: (hbnb) show BaseModel 1234-1234-1234
Ex: (hbnb) destroy BaseModel 1234-1234-1234
etc
